## Results (Quick Summary)
- Female students have higher average reading and writing scores.
- Male students have higher average math scores.
- Higher parental education level tends to correlate with better math performance.
- Standard lunch group shows higher average scores across subjects.

## Files
- `StudentsPerformance.csv` → Dataset
- `analysis.ipynb` → Python analysis notebook (run outputs included)

## Next Steps
- Build a Tableau Public dashboard (Gender vs Scores, Parental Education vs Math, Lunch vs Performance)
- Add SQL queries file (`analysis.sql`)
